    question: "What makes Muslim Settify different from free YouTube training?",
    answer:
      "Two things: our exclusive training and job board, and an active community. We curate hundreds of roles for our students and maintain a private community of 100+ members offering peer accountability, scheduled coaching calls, and networking opportunities. You're not learning alone from videos—you have structured accountability and direct guidance.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Do I need prior sales experience?",
    answer:
      "No. The program is designed for complete beginners and includes comprehensive training on all aspects of appointment setting, from initial outreach to advanced follow-up. Many of our most consistent students started with zero sales background.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "How much time do I need to dedicate weekly?",
    answer:
      "During the 8-week training, expect 10-15 hours per week including live sessions, practice, and assignments. Once working, most setters dedicate 20-30 hours per week, though this is flexible based on your income goals and availability.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What if my English isn't perfect?",
    answer:
      "Clear communication is important, but native-level fluency is not required. We provide scripts and templates, and many successful setters are non-native English speakers. Minor accent or grammar issues rarely affect results.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Can I do this while working full-time?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Many students complete the training while employed full-time. Live sessions are recorded for flexibility, and the remote nature of appointment setting allows you to work around your existing schedule.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "How long until I start earning?",
    answer:
      "Many students land their first client within 4-8 weeks of completing the program, though timelines vary based on effort and consistency. Results vary.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Do you help me find clients?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The program includes career support such as resume review, outreach templates, interview preparation, and access to our exclusive training and job board featuring businesses actively seeking setters.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "What kind of support do I get after completing the program?",
    answer:
      "You'll receive access to all course materials, ongoing community support through our private group, and continued access to our exclusive training and job board with hundreds of roles available over time. You're never left on your own.",
